# Ladli-Foundation-Website-Work
The work done and the resources used by me during the tenure of my 2 months internship at Ladli Foundation. 
The page was designed using HTML,CSS and  bit of JavaScript. Some external libraries were also used for carrying out specific purposes. 

Developing and designing a page from the scratch that too for the NGO which is doing a lot for the humanity and especially for the women was the experience to cherish for me. This was 2 months of internship which would live with me throughout my life.
